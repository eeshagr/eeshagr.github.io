													<td>Danceability</td>

													<td>Energy</td>
													<td>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</td>

													<td>Instrumentalness</td>
													<td>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.</td>

													<td>Speechiness</td>
													<td>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. </td>

                    This program scrapes the Billboard music chart website and records the Hot 100 songs every week within a certain period.
                    </p><p>
                    The program uses Beautiful Soup for webscraping. The datetime module is also used to compare and iterate time, while the time module is used to delay the looping so that the IP address won’t be blocked.

                        <p><i>readTime</i> - converts a date from a string to a datetime value</p>
<pre>def readTime(ti):

                        <p><i>rereadTime</i> - reads in a date (string/datetime) and reformats it</p>
<pre>def rereadTime(ti):
    reread = str(ti)
    return (dt.datetime.strptime(reread, "%Y-%m-%d")).date()</pre>
                        <p><i>incrementTime</i> - increments time (string/datetime) by a week</p>
<pre>def incrementTime(ti):
    return (rereadTime(ti) + dt.timedelta(weeks=1))</pre>
                        
                        <h4>Scrape function</h4>
                        <p>The <i>scrape</i> function takes in a date and a CSV file name to scrape the Hot 100 songs for the given date and write in the necessary data into the given csv file. By looking at the html code of the Billboard website, we were able to extract the classes for the necessary data.</p>

                        <h4>Execution of functions</h4>
                        <p>A while loop is used to increment the start date every week until the date exceeds the end of the period. The <i>scrape</i> function is placed within this loop, causing the Billboard website to be scraped every week. After the scrape function is run, the program is delayed to prevent the IP address from being blocked.</p>
<pre># WHILE DATE &lt; END DATE, SCRAPE

while date &lt; scrapeUntil:
    scrape(date, fileName)

    # WAIT FOR A WHILE
    time.sleep(abs(np.random.normal(5)))

    # INCREMENT DATE
    date = incrementTime(date)</pre>

                        <p>Two programs were used to retrieve spotify audio features for Billboard Hot 100 songs. The first program, webscrapeSpotifyPlaylists.py, was used to scrape specified spotify playlists from a chosen user, retrieving the song URIs of every song in the playlists. The second program read these song URIs and retrieved the Spotify audio features. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Both programs use the <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">spotipy</a> module, which is a library for using the Spotify Web API.

                        </p>
                        <p>An issue was that the spotipy function user_playlists only searches the 50 latest playlists for a user and therefore cannot be used reliably. To ensure that every playlist is obtained, the function <i>get_playlist</i> indexes through every playlist manually.</p>
<pre>def get_playlist(username):
    results = sp.user_playlists(username)
    playlists = results['items']
    while results['next']:

                        <p>To search for playlists, we run the get_playlist function, inputting a username URI.</p>
<pre>playlists = get_playlist(user)</pre>
                        <p>After obtaining the playlist data, conditionally select playlists that have the key in it. Then select playlists that include songs from 1980 or later. Append the year of the playlist and playlist URI to separate lists.</p>
<pre># FOR EVERY PLAYLIST:
for i in range(len(playlists)):
    # IF KEY PHRASE IS IN PLAYLIST NAME:
    if key in playlists[i]['name']:
        # FIND THE YEAR IN PLAYLIST NAME
        year = int(playlists[i]['name'][:4]) # year = first 4 strings in playlist name
        # TAKE ONLY PLAYLISTS OF BILLBOARD DATA AFTER 1980
        if year >= 1980:
            # APPEND YEAR, PLAYLIST NAME, PLAYLIST URI TO RELEVANT LISTS
            playlistYear.append(year)
            playlistURIs.append(playlists[i]['uri'])</pre>
                        <h4>Searching Spotify for song data</h4>
                        <p>After obtaining the playlist URIs of the playlists chosen for scraping, we loop through each playlist to get the song URIs of every song.</p>
                        <p>Similar to user_playlist, we discovered that the spotipy function user_playlist_tracks only retrieves data from the first 100 songs in a playlist. Therefore, the function <i>get_playlist_tracks</i> was made to index through every song using a while loop. </p>
