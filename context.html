						<h2>Context and motivation</h2>

                        <p><br>The way music is consumed nowadays has changed drastically since streaming services have become the main platforms, replacing CDs and vinyls. Streaming revenue now accounts for more than 80% of music revenue in the US with a 2900% increase in streaming revenue between 2008 and 2018 <a href="https://www.riaa.com/riaa-releases-2019-mid-year-music-industry-revenue-report/">(Friedlander, 2019)</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/8836/streaming-proportion-of-us-music-revenue/">(Richter, 2019)</a>. Changes in revenue reflect increasing consumer adoption of streaming services since their introduction. This is supported by the downward trend of digital downloads and physical music purchases revenues since online sharing revolutionised the music industry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883584/streaming-record-sales-music-industry-revenue">(Hernandez, 2018)</a>. This group predicts that the consumption and production of music will have changed as a result of the change in the way consumers listen to music.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
						<h3>Consumption</h3>
						<p>In terms of consumption, streaming platforms’ music recommendation algorithms have facilitated the emergence of breakout artists and shaped tastes and listening diversity. These recommendation algorithms mean that consumers are exposed to new music automatically. This is similar to tuning in to a favourite radio station which will play new songs similar to the music the station expects its listeners to enjoy. However, consumers are now able to create playlists and “like” their favourite songs, providing a personalized collection of music which in turn adjusts the algorithms recommendations.</p>
                        <p>It is unclear the impact that adoption of music streaming services have had on total music consumption by listening time. Nielsen Music reported in 2019 that the average American is listening to less music, down from 32.1 hours in 2017 to 26.9 hours in 2019 <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/8529828/average-music-listening-time-down ">(Peoples, 2019)</a>. However, the IFPI claims that average worldwide music consumption has increased to 18 hours (from 17.8 in 2018) in 2019 <a href="https://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Music-Listening-2019.pdf">(IFPI, 2019)</a>. This group hypothesizes two possible scenarios. Perhaps streaming services make listeners more deliberate in their musical consumption, selectively streaming certain tracks, listening to their favourite music more but total music less. Conversely streaming services might facilitate increased consumption in the developing world through making music more affordable. This could explain an increase in music consumption worldwide despite a downwards trend in the USA. </p>

                    <div class="box">
				        <h3>Production</h3>
				            <p>We are also investigating the way in which the adoption of music streaming services has influenced the production of music. Changes in audio features like “danceability”, “energy”, “instrumentalness”, “valence” and “speechiness” have also been investigated. These are metrics provided by Spotify which describe characteristics of music. These features are less useful for looking at individual tracks but provide a framework for analysing broader changes in music’s production.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box">
				        <h3>Motivation</h3>
				        <p>This research is important for many reasons. Understanding the impact of streaming services on consumption means that music labels, artists and streaming services have more information about how consumers will listen to music. Artists and labels can use this information when producing new music and streaming services can use it to better understand how artists are impacted by streaming services. Data from this report could guide streaming services decisions, improving recommendation algorithms and providing useful business metrics.</p> 
                   
                        <p>Whether or not streaming services have influenced changes in production and consumption, knowledge for its own right is still a worthy pursuit. We chose this topic because all of us are keenly interested in music. We recognise that music is hugely important for people all over the world and we were interested to see whether there has been a relationship between the adoption of streaming services and the consumption and production of music. With such a widespread adoption of streaming services there are likely some effects. Perhaps these do not pertain to the music itself and instead are more impactful for the artists, record labels or culture of music. This initial research provides rigorous empirical foundations for further investigation into the effects of streaming services, an area we consider important.</p>
