                        <h4>Acousticness</h4>
                        
                        <p>
                            Looking at acousticness from 2007 onwards, overall there has been a clear increase, beginning at around 0.14 and ending at around 0.22 by 2019. This does not fit the overall trend for acousticness, which is a steady fall - an r-value of -0.7 confirms that overall there is quite a strong negative correlation, as looking at acousticness per decade, acousticness only began to rise in the 2000s. Acousticness fluctuates fairly regularly; there was a significant jump from 2018 to 2019, for example, yet overall it is difficult to pinpoint a believable trend which links less acoustic music over time to the introduction of streaming services.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Danceability</h4>
                        
                        <h4>Energy</h4>
                        
                        <h4>Instrumentalness</h4>
                        <p>Instrumentalness has been assumed to be a binary indicator, as it aims to predict whether a track contains vocals or not with any value above 0.5 intended to represent a track that is instrumental. Instrumentalness has fluctuated steadily from 1980 to present: whilst there is overall a downward trend, with an r-value of -0.49 indicating a negative correlation, the steady rise and fall from around 2000 onwards ending with a consistent period of zero intensity from 2015 to present suggests the overall trend is perhaps not indicative of the current level of instrumentalness. Songs on the Hot 100 from 2015 onwards are shown to never be instrumental tracks, which coincides with streaming services dominating music consumption.</p>
                        <h4>Speechiness</h4>
                       <p> Speechiness overall is shown to have a clear increase from 1980 to present, starting at 0.042 and reaching 0.14 by 2019 - an r-value of 0.8 shows strong positive correlation. Around 2013, the increase in speechiness becomes far more rapid, with the most significant period of increase occurring around 2015. This is particularly notable due to the period of decrease in speechiness preceding after it peaked in 2003 at 0.144. Looking at intensity of speechiness per decade, the only time speechiness was not rising is from the 1970's to 1980's, showing that overall, music has been moving towards more speech present in tracks. Furthermore, it seems that around the introduction of streaming the rate of increase in speechiness in fact slowed down. Yet overall, the significance of these patterns is perhaps limited as these values indicate that on average most tracks are non-speech-like, as a value below 0.33 does not indicate that there is a significant amount of speech in tracks.</p>
