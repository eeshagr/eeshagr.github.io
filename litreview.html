						<p>Over the past decade, streaming services have come to take up a significant proportion of the market for music consumption. Between 2008 and 2018, music streaming revenue jumped from $0.3b to $8.9b, with total industry revenue $17.1b and $19.1b (Richter, 2019). Streaming dominates music consumption in the US, growing from 1% to 80% of the total music industry revenue between 2005 and 2019 (Richter, 2019). Simultaneously, as technology has progressed and music consumption entered the digital era, album sales declined. It can be argued that the rise in music piracy was a contributing factor: with the rise of services such as Napster, a file-sharing service, music piracy became far more accessible (no source? https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/). </p><p>However, there is also some evidence that streaming services have had a net positive effect on music industry revenues because displaced sales are “outweighed by the gains in streaming revenue” and “streaming displaces music piracy” (Aguiar, 2018). There is further evidence that music streamers are more likely to pirate music than their non-streaming counterparts (Borja, 2016) but this does not necessarily mean that there is not a net reduction in music piracy as previous ‘piraters’ may decide it is easier to pay for a streaming service than pirate music. Thus streaming services are a useful way to analyse the music industry as a whole due to their share of the market of digital music consumers, with services such as Spotify offering both free and paid plans. Overall, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music may be able to widen the market for music (media/culture site same as above). This research project therefore aims to explore the relationship between the widespread adoption of streaming services as users’ primary way of consuming music and the changes in said music.

                        <p>
                        There is evidence that the adoption of streaming services significantly increases the quantity and diversity of music consumed, and not just in the short term. “Even after half a year, adopters play substantially more, and more diverse, music” (Datta et al, 2018). Datta et al concluded that, “relative to music ownership, where experimentation is expensive, adoption of streaming increases new music discovery”: as listening to more diverse music no longer comes with an immediate cost through streaming, users are able to experiment with their preferences to a greater extent. Datta et al also note that “while repeat listening to new music decreases, users’ best discoveries have higher play rates”, showing that allowing users to access more music without an additional cost allows for a fluidity in preferences that can increase the time consumers spend using streaming services.
                        </p>
                        <p>On the production end, Hiller et al (2018) argue that changes will encourage “musicians to release fewer songs, but at a higher quality” and reduce the “bundling” phenomenon, making the traditional album less important, perhaps offering some explanation for the decline in album sales in recent years. Hiller et al claim that there is evidence that many producers are moving towards creating music for streaming. Mack (2019) supports this idea, asserting that songs have decreased in length because producers are paid “if someone listens to 30 seconds of a song” - as a stream is counted if a user listens to the first 30 seconds only, the full length of the song is of less importance than making sure the beginning is engaging enough to ensure a user keeps listening. Assuming that to at least some extent, producers are aiming to profit from music production, The Economist’s argument (2019) that not only that songs are shorter but also that they are “getting snappier, with shorter intros and earlier choruses” can be seen as a direct result of streaming. </p>
