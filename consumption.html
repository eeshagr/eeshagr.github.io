                        <h3>Diversity in artists and monopolisation of top charts</h3>
                        <p>With the line graph below, we wanted to observe the impact of streaming services on the artists or bands who appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, more specifically if there is a wide variety of performers on the charts (diversity) or if, on the contrary, if there is only a handful of performers that dominate the charts (monopolisation). Therefore, the lower the average of the number of times artists or bands’ appearances on charts, the more diverse it is because it signifies that more musicians are listened to by the general public. </p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mioana.bodea/49.embed"></iframe>
                        <p><br>This line graph shows that there is no overall trend regarding the average number of times artists or bands have appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from 1980 to 2019 but that the data fluctuates. Before 1998, the average of musicians’ appearances on charts does not show drastic changes ranging between 14 and 18. However, in 1999, the mean of musicians’ appearances on the chart increased remarkably up to 30% suggesting that something significant happened that year. Furthermore, the period after 2015 appears to have a strong decrease to %, going from 19.8 to 9.4. Given our assumptions, the latter implies that a wider panel of artists was listened to. Following the introduction and popularisation of streaming services around 2005, there is a general increase until 2015  and then a strong decrease, with the average reaching its maximum value and its minimum value 2012 in 2019. In order to confirm the relationship between the mean of musicians’ appearances on the chart and Spotify’s user growth, we conducted a Spearman’s correlation.</p>

                        <iframe width="100%" height="110" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mioana.bodea/40.embed"></iframe>
                        <p><br>The table shows that the mean of musicians’ appearances on the chart and Spotify’s user growth are strong negatively correlated. In other words, as the popularity of Spotify grows, the average number of artists’ appearances on Billboard decreases. </p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, we can make a limited analysis of the diversity and monopolisation of top chart based solely on this line graph. Hence, we have traced another line representing the total number of artists that have appeared on the top charts, excluding  “featuring”. </p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mioana.bodea/57.embed"></iframe> 
                        <p><br>This updated line graph shows that the yearly average of artists’ appearances on charts is inversely correlated to the yearly total number of artists on charts. The yearly total number of artists on the charts has a general decreasing trend. This can be explained by the fact that, when observing the raw data, we can see that more featuring tracks have appeared in the charts in the last couple of years, and since we haven’t included them due to clarity purposes, the total number of artists appears to be low. We can split this updated line graph into 3 distinct periods: pre-1999, 1999-2015 and 2015-2019. In the first period, the difference between the two lines is small, overlapping at times, implying that there is diversity. The total number of artists decreases only by 17% in this period. However, between 1999 and 2015, the large gap between the two sets of data indicates that the average of the number of artists’ appearances on charts is heavily influenced upwards by a few exceptions since the total number decreases until hitting its minimum in 2012. However, post-2015, the difference between the two becomes smaller once more, meaning that there is an increasingly wider variety of performers on the charts.
                        From a streaming services perspective, the post-2015 shift can be explained by the fact that streaming services have doubled in that year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/07/nielsen-music-streams-doubled-in-2015-digital-sales-continue-to-fall/">(Perez, 2015)</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to better visualise and understand the impact and scope of dominating musicians in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, we have plotted the raw data into a boxplot with visible outliers. Hover over the outliers with your mouse to see which artist or band has generally more appearances each year! You can also focus on only 5 years at a time, just click the option below and move the boxplot:</p>
                         <iframe width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mioana.bodea/58.embed"></iframe>
                    <p><br>This boxplot shows the spread of artists’ appearances on the Billboard chart from 1980 to 2019 which is overall positively skewed, meaning that the number of artists with few appearances is bigger. We can observe that pre-2004, before the popularisation of streaming services, the outliers have barely surpassed 100, reaching maximum 103 in 1995, while post-2004, after the popularisation of streaming services, the outliers reach much higher values (167 in 2018 by Ariana Grande) with generally negatively skewed. These observations confirm our previous claims from the updated line graph but refute our initial hypothesis: The diversity of artists decreased with the popularisation of streaming services making a few artists have a  monopoly on popular music. </p>

                        <p><br>This line graph shows that from 1980 to 2019 there has been a general decrease in the number of new artists that break into the billboard top 100. The frequency of breakout artists has more than halved, falling from 110 in 1980 to 54 in 2019. The biggest change between any two consecutive years occurred between 1980 and 1999, when the frequency fell from 122 to 73. Noticeably, the period after 1999 displays a decreasing trend, matching the overall trend of the graph. However, the period before 1999 appears to have an increasing trend, suggesting something significant happened in the year 1999 to shift the trend. Following the introduction of streaming services in 2007, there is a general decreasing trend, with the frequency of breakout artists reaching its minimum value, 52, in 2010 and 2012. </p>

                        <p><br>The histograms for the number of breakout artists before and after the introduction of streaming services show that the two distributions have minimal overlap and are largely distinct. The pre-streaming data has a greater spread, covering frequencies between 54 and 125. The post streaming data, on the other hand, covers frequencies between 52 and 79, and is also slightly skewed towards the lower frequency values. To check whether these differences are significant we can conduct a t-test.</p>

                        <p><br>Overall, the line graph shows an increasing trend in the number of weeks songs spend on the billboard top hundred. While the trend shows constant fluctuation from year to year, there are two elements of particular interest. The first being from the years 2000-2011 where there is minimal fluctuation in the data, suggesting that the average number of weeks songs spend on the chart was plateauing or stabilizing. Secondly, the graph shows this plateau was broken by a significant jump between 2011-2012. This increase is the most substantial increase between two consecutive years displayed on the graph. The 2012 spike is of particular interest to us because spotify user growth nearly tripled from 2011 to 2012. This leads us to speculate that streaming services may have played a role in increasing the average number of weeks that songs spend on the billboard top 100, an idea explored further through the following histogram. </p>
                        
                        <iframe width="100%" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~apara02/7.embed"></iframe>
                        <p><br>The histograms for the number of weeks songs spend on the billboard top 100 before and after the introduction of streaming services show that the two distributions have some overlap but are fairly distinct. The pre-streaming data covers a greater range of weeks spent on the chart, including weekly averages between 5 and 15. On the other hand, the post-streaming data has a greater proportion of data points centered around higher weekly averages. To check whether these differences are significant we can carry out a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test on the two data sets.</p>

                        <p><br>This graph looks at songs that have reached rank number 1 on Billboard for the specified year on the slider. Each pink line represents one song and shows how the rank changes from when the song is introduced in the charts until it leaves - we refer to this as the lifetime of the song. The dark green line is the average lifetime of a Billboard number one song according to the year. Above and below the dark green line is a filled light-green area, which represents one standard deviation above and below the average and gives us a sense of how much the pink lines vary. The dark red vertical line represents the average total time spent on charts. For some years, this line disappears or is beyond the main activity of the graph. This is because some songs resurface on the charts many weeks later and pushed the average outwards. If you zoom out, you will see the red line.</p>
                        <p>The two graphs are the same. The reason why we have two figures is because the original graph was too large to host on plotly chart studio, and we would’ve essentially had to pay to embed it on our website. To be within the size limits, we split the original graph into two: one graph plotting everything but in two year increments, the other graph plotting only the means but for every year.</p>
                        <p>As the year increases, the red line and the dark green line move further away from the origin, signifying that number 1 songs are spending more time on the charts. Songs usually peak right before 10 weeks. Since 1990, once the average number 1 song has peaked, the rate at which the rank decreases slows down. </p>
                        <p>Between 1980 and 2009, the average time a number one song spends on the top 100 charts fluctuates between 20 and 30 weeks. However, from 2009 onwards, the average time spent stays at 30 weeks or above, with a trend of increase. From our research, we found evidence that the top 100 is seeing a fewer number of artists dominate the charts. This corresponds to the increasing time that a number one song spends on charts, and suggests famous artists release hit songs that are streamed intensively.</p>
                        <p>Between 1980 and 1991, the rank at which tracks leave the charts stays fairly constant at around 90, with minor up-and-down fluctuations. However, in 1992, the rank decreases significantly to 40 and then continues to fluctuate around 40 till the present day. This does not support our hypothesis and implies that widespread adoption of streaming services did not have the most significant impact of average rank of a song leaving the charts. Interestingly, research claims that 1991 was the “most significant revolution in the history of pop music”, arguing that the rise of rap and hip-hop was the most important event in shaping the “musical structural of the American charts” (Thompson, 2015). Although this does not prove a causal relationship between the significant change in the rank where a song leaves the charts and the emergence of hip-hop, it is still curious that these events coincide.</p>
                        <p>It also gets harder to predict the journey or the shape of the curve. If we look at the pink lines compared to the green line, the earlier years show similar patterns of increase and decrease in rank. For instance, the years 1984, 1986, 1990 show a thick and uniform collection of pink lines, producing a similar average green line and a smooth, relatively thin standard deviation area. Before 2010, the lifetime of number 1 hits were consistent and predictable. After 2010, the lifetimes are unpredictable and inconsistent. The introduction of streaming services does not seem to have a significant effect on the lifetime of a song. However, it could be argued that monopolisation of charts might lead to more predictable lifetimes of number one songs because you could expect that the most successful artists would have a track on the charts for a long time. More indepth research that focuses on tracking an artist’s popularity and its effect on hit songs is required to explain whether or not this correlation exists.</p>
