						<h2>Conclusion</h2>

					<div class="box">
						<p>Overall, we were able to explore almost all of what we set out to do when we formulated our research question and came up with hypotheses. Despite our initial assumptions, we found that, for music consumptions post-streaming services, there is a monopolisation of popular music by a handful of artists and that, consequently, breakout artist have a lower chance of being introduced in the top charts. For music production post-streaming services, the tracks become increasingly shorter, focusing on lower energy and fewer instrumentals.  
</p>
                        <p>With our research into existing literature surrounding the topic combined with the analysis we carried out, we believe there is a strong case for the argument that the way music has changed in recent years is partially due to the impact of streaming services. Undoubtedly our project leaves space for future research to look further into what we were unable to do. Our approach was fairly simplistic for such a complex matter that takes into account a wide rage of factors. Song complexity is one such feature, as is whether or not the way songs are counted as streams (listening to the first 30 seconds) affects how a pop song is produced. However, we believe our findings nonetheless remain an interesting contribution to the research surrounding how streaming services have changed popular music.</p>
