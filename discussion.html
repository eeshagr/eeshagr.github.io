						<h2>Discussion</h2>
					<h5>This section attempts to the findings of our research and place into the wider world context. This includes, wherever possible, connecting it back to the literature review,  linking it to any other research that might support or explain our results, and finally, providing ideas of how this research can be developed in the future.

                        <h3>Consumption</h3>
                        <p>From our analysis of breakout artists, we can conclude that after the introduction of streaming services the number of new artists breaking into the Billboard Hot 100 has reduced. This contradicts our hypothesis as well as what we found during the literature review. This discrepancy could possibly be attributed to the way in which Billboard weighs the importance of streaming services [is it proportional to the % of music revenue that is generated by streaming service - 80% - and how long has it been weighted at this much?]. One way of interpreting this discrepancy is that the introduction of streaming services has redefined what it means to be a breakout artist. It is possible that new artists now focus on gaining popularity on streaming services rather than entering the Hot 100 chart. This would explain the fact the line graph shows a change in trend in 1999, the year Napster was introduced. This could be an interesting idea to explore in future research - how streaming services and internet culture redefine identities like being a breakout artist.</p>
                        <p>According to our analysis of weeks on chart, the average number of weeks that songs spend on the Billboard Hot 100 has increased post the introduction of streaming services. This can be tied to the fact that listeners listen to individual tracks more than albums now, and that listening hours have increased because people listen to individual tracks more, as we found in our literature review.</p>
                        <p>From our analysis of diversity in artists and the monopolisation of the top charts, we found that while the average number of   artist appearances have increased drastically, the number of artists on charts per year have decreased which signifies that there is a monopolisation of charts by a few popular artists from 1998 to 2015, which is not what we expected. However, from 2015 we can see an increase in the number of artists on charts and a decrease in the average of artists’ appearances on charts, meaning overall there is a rise in diversity of artists. The box plot we produced confirms these observations. When doing the Spearman’s Correlation from the average of appearances and Spotify’s growth, we can observe that is weakly negatively correlated, so the more users there are on Spotify the lower the diversity of the pool of artists, despite the potential streaming services have to introduce listeners to a greater range of music.</p>

						<h3>Production</h3>
                        <p>From our analysis of the production end of popular music over time, certain factors have clearer links to streaming services than others. Duration is perhaps one element that can be linked clearly to the introduction of streaming services: taking into account how songs have, recently, gotten shorter, how artists are paid for their music can perhaps explain this. Mack <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18642978/music-streaming-spotify-song-length-distribution-production-switched-on-pop-vergecast-interview">(2019)</a> asserts that songs have decreased in length because producers are paid “if someone listens to 30 seconds of a song” - as a stream is counted if a user listens to the first 30 seconds only, the full length of the song is of less importance than making sure the beginning is engaging enough to ensure a user keeps listening. According to The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/07/one-quarter-of-spotify-tracks-are-skipped-in-first-five-seconds-study-reveals">(2014)</a>, in fact one quarter of tracks on Spotify are skipped in the first five seconds, meaning long song introductions are no longer profitable. Thus the trend of decreasing song length can be interpreted as a result of the increasing ubiquity of streaming services: in order to profit, the overall length of a song does not matter as much as ensuring the first 30 seconds appeal to users of streaming services and thus will not be skipped.</p><p>The decrease in instrumentalness and the rise in speechiness in recent years can also be linked to streaming services. Other factors must also be taken into account: a change in cultural preference results in a change in what genres of music dominate the popular charts. With hip-hop and rap music entering the mainstream by the end of the 20th century <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32599916">(Morelle, 2015)</a>, the popularity of a certain type of song would inevitably influence the features of songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Yet the accelerating popularity of hip-hop and rap, specifically, can indeed be linked to streaming services; Stewart <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/what-genres-have-benefited-the-most-from-the-streaming-era-of-music/2018/04/03/950e99a8-3695-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html ">(2018)</a> argues that streaming services allowed the hip-hop genre to grow because artists were more suited to the shift in how music is released due to how accustomed artists already were with releasing music through similar platforms such as SoundCloud, which require a steady release of music as opposed to the single-and-album releases popular in other genres. </p>
