						The popularity of streaming services in recent years has become increasingly significant. Over the past decade, streaming services have come to take up a significant proportion of the market for music consumption: between 2008 and 2018, music streaming revenue jumped from $0.3 billion to $8.9 billion, with total industry revenue going from $17.1 billion to $19.1 billion <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/8836/streaming-proportion-of-us-music-revenue/">(Richter, 2019)</a>. Streaming dominates music consumption in the US, growing from 1% to 80% of total music industry revenue between 2005 and 2019 <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/8836/streaming-proportion-of-us-music-revenue/">(Richter, 2019)</a>.</div>
                    <div class="box">Despite the growth in overall music industry revenue, as technology has progressed and music consumption entered the digital era, album sales declined. It can be argued that the rise in music piracy was a contributing factor: with the rise of services such as Napster, a file-sharing service, music piracy became far more accessible, according to 'Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication' <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture">(2016)</a>. However, there is also some evidence that streaming services have had a net positive effect on music industry revenues because displaced sales are “outweighed by the gains in streaming revenue” and “streaming displaces music piracy” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167718717301753">(Aguiar and Waldfogel, 2018)</a>. There is further evidence that music streamers are more likely to pirate music than their non-streaming counterparts <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698916301849#s0055">(Borja and Dieringer, 2016)</a> but this does not necessarily mean that there is not a net reduction in music piracy as previous ‘piraters’ may decide it is easier to pay for a streaming service than pirate music. Thus streaming services are a useful way to analyse the music industry as a whole due to their share of the market of digital music consumers, with services such as Spotify offering both free and paid plans. Overall, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music may be able to widen the market for music <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture">(n.a.,2016)</a>. This research project therefore aims to explore the relationship between the widespread adoption of streaming services as users’ primary way of consuming music and the changes in said music: changes such as a decrease in album sales, for example, may be explained by how streaming services have led to a change in how users consume popular music.</div>
                        <div class="box">
                        There is evidence that the adoption of streaming services significantly increases the quantity and diversity of music consumed, and not just in the short term. “Even after half a year, adopters play substantially more, and more diverse, music” <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mksc.2017.1051">(Datta et al, 2018)</a>. Datta et al concluded that, “relative to music ownership, where experimentation is expensive, adoption of streaming increases new music discovery”: as listening to more diverse music no longer comes with an immediate cost through streaming, users are able to experiment with their preferences to a greater extent. Datta et al also note that “while repeat listening to new music decreases, users’ best discoveries have higher play rates”, showing that allowing users to access more music without an additional cost allows for a fluidity in preferences that can increase the time consumers spend using streaming services.  
                        </div>
                        <div class="box">On the production end, Hiller and Walter <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/rne.2017.16.issue-4/rne-2017-0064/rne-2017-0064.xml
                            ">(2018)</a> argue that changes will encourage “musicians to release fewer songs, but at a higher quality” and reduce the “bundling” phenomenon, making the traditional album less important, perhaps offering further explanation for the decline in album sales in recent years. Hiller et al claim that there is evidence that many producers are moving towards creating music for streaming. Assuming that to at least some extent, producers are aiming to profit from music production, The Economist’s argument <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/10/05/the-economics-of-streaming-is-changing-pop-songs
                            ">(2019)</a> that not only that songs are shorter but also that they are “getting snappier, with shorter intros and earlier choruses” can be seen as a direct result of streaming. Indeed, The Economist <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/10/05/the-economics-of-streaming-is-changing-pop-songs
                            ">(2019)</a> goes so far as to highlight the importance of producing something that specifically “sounds like Spotify” - evidently, therefore, there is an increasing necessity of appealing directly to users who make use of streaming services, and this is done by changing features of popular music to make it more suited to the format of streaming. </div>
                        <div class="box">A similar study to the one we are carrying out was performed by Mauch et al <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.150081#d3e907
                            ">(2015)</a>. In "The evolution of popular music: USA 1960-2010", the authors conclude that a quantitative analysis can demonstrate changes in music over time. Their research also consisted of songs from Billboard’s top 100, using different audio features to investigate changes. However, the authors stopped the analysis in 2010, just as streaming services burgeoned into ubiquity. The research in our paper, although including earlier years too, is predicated on analysing changes in music since streaming services’ widespread adoption. Whilst Mauch et al <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.150081#d3e907
                            ">(2015)</a> have analysed how popular music has changed, this project has attempted to analyse changes and then provide an explanation. We believe that streaming services may be one of the most significant sources of widespread change to the production and consumption of music. Although difficult to prove causational relationships, we believe that relationships may exist between streaming services’ adoption and music’s consumption and production.   </div>
