						<h2>Limitations</h2>
					<h5>Like all research projects, this one too has flaws. In this section we have discussed some of the most crucial shortcomings of our project. This can be used to view our results through an honest lens. Alternately, any one inspired to carry out a similar study can improve on these. </h5>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
				    <ul>
                        <li>We experienced some setbacks whilst conducting our analysis. 
                        It is important to note that this project only looks at the Billboard Top 100, which is perhaps too limited a range of songs to gain a full picture of how music has changed. Maybe it is the case that any changes in music are made less visible. For example, although many new genres have emerged, perhaps at least in part as a result of streaming, and many tracks have for example become “darker”, these changes are not so visible because of our focus exclusively on popular music.
                        </li>
                        <li>Furthermore, we have only used Spotify as a reference when it comes to streaming services, despite the numerous other services such as Apple Music. In future research, all streaming services should be taken into consideration when doing relationship examinations.</li>
                        <li>Initially our plan was to search every song we retrieved from the Billboard web scrape on Spotify. However, the search functions were unreliable and we resorted in scraping the Spotify data off unverified, regular Spotify users and their public playlists. Although these users stated that they got their data from the Billboard charts, there is no way of confirming the accuracy of their data. </li>
                        <li>As well as this, our study is ultimately correlational. It is hard to conclude for many features whether changes are a result of streaming services or for other reasons. There is no real way of discerning causes for changes, and particularly data on production is more about the correlational relationship rather than causation, despite us finding evidence to support our hypothesis that these changes are to at least some extent caused by streaming.</li>
                        <li>Whilst we managed to explore most of our hypotheses,  we were not able to find sufficient data to explore one aspect of music production: we could not look into whether or not songs that are on the top charts are less complex after the introduction of streaming services into the mainstream. This is perhaps an interesting angle for future research.</li>
                    </ul>
