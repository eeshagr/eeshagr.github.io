<h3>Retrieving Billboard data</h3>
                        
                    <p>
                    This program scrapes the Billboard music chart website and records the Hot 100 songs every week within a certain period.
                    </p>
                        <p>We chose Billboard as our data source because it is a popular music chart in America and the UK. Billboard has been used in many studies as a scale of popularity (eg. Lopes, 1992; Pettijohn & Sacco 2009).</p>
                        <p>
                    The program uses Beautiful Soup for webscraping. The datetime module is also used to compare and iterate time, while the time module is used to delay the looping so that the IP address won’t be blocked.
                    </p>

                        <h4>Time functions</h4>
                        
                        <p>The following three functions are used throughout the code to compare and iterate time: </p>

                        <p><i>readTime</i> - converts a date from a string to a datetime value</p>
<pre>def readTime(ti):
    return (dt.datetime.strptime(ti, "%Y-%m-%d")).date()</pre>
                        <p><i>rereadTime</i> - reads in a date (string/datetime) and reformats it</p>
<pre>def rereadTime(ti):
    reread = str(ti)
    return (dt.datetime.strptime(reread, "%Y-%m-%d")).date()</pre>
                        <p><i>incrementTime</i> - increments time (string/datetime) by a week</p>
<pre>def incrementTime(ti):
    return (rereadTime(ti) + dt.timedelta(weeks=1))</pre>
                        
                        <h4>Scrape function</h4>
                        <p>The <i>scrape</i> function takes in a date and a CSV file name to scrape the Hot 100 songs for the given date and write in the necessary data into the given csv file. By looking at the html code of the Billboard website, we were able to extract the classes for the necessary data.</p>
                        
                        <ul style="list-style-type:decimal-leading-zero">

                               <ul style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                                   <li>Retrieve and format song data, eg. to find song name and artist name:
<pre>songName = allData[i].find("span", {"class": songClass}).text
artistName = allData[i].find("span", {"class": artistClass}).text
</pre>
                                   </li>
                                   <li>Append song data into inputted CSV file
                                   </li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Execution of functions</h4>
                        <p>A while loop is used to increment the start date every week until the date exceeds the end of the period. The <i>scrape</i> function is placed within this loop, causing the Billboard website to be scraped every week. After the scrape function is run, the program is delayed to prevent the IP address from being blocked.</p>
<pre># WHILE DATE &lt; END DATE, SCRAPE

while date &lt; scrapeUntil:
    scrape(date, fileName)

    time.sleep(abs(np.random.normal(5))) # wait for a while
    date = incrementTime(date) # increment date

                        <p>Why 2 datasets? The first dataset allows us to look into granular changes between years. However, since it only includes the top 100 Billboard songs of the year, there isn’t enough data to form accurate conclusions about general trends. The second dataset includes every Billboard Hot 100 song that appeared on the charts within a certain decade, which amounts to an average of 3720 songs per decade (372 songs per year). This dataset is therefore used to look at overall trends in audio features through decades, but not specific changes that could solely evidence a correlation between production choices and the introduction of streaming services.</p>
                        <p>
We chose Spotify as our data source because Spotify made it easy to access their open source data. This is likely in efforts to encourage developers and businesses to take interest in the platform. Spotify acquired the company Sonalytic, which specialised in making the algorithms to detect and process audio features, suggesting that the data is reliable (McIntyre, 2017). 
</p>
                        <p>This program was used to scrape specified spotify playlists from a chosen user, retrieving the song URIs of every song in the playlists. Then, using song URIs, Spotify audio features for every song were searched and written into a CSV file. </p>
                        <p>The <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">spotipy</a> module, a library for using the Spotify Web API, was used to search spotify for song data and audio features. </p>

                        <h4>Retrieval of playlist data</h4>
                        <p>First, the playlist data, most importantly the URIs of the chosen playlists, are found and saved into separate lists.
                        </p>
                        <p>An issue was that the spotipy function user_playlists only searches the 50 latest playlists for a user and therefore cannot be used reliably. To ensure that every playlist is obtained, the function <i>get_playlist</i> indexes through every playlist manually.</p>
<pre>def get_playlist(username):
    results = sp.user_playlists(username)
    playlists = results['items']
    while results['next']:
        results = sp.next(results)
        playlists.extend(results['items'])
    return playlists</pre>
                        <p>To search for playlists, we run the get_playlist function, inputting a username URI.</p>
<pre>playlists = get_playlist(user)</pre>
                        <p>After obtaining the playlist data, the programme conditionally selects playlists that have the key in it. Then selects playlists that include songs from 1980 or later. It then appends the year of the playlist and playlist URI to separate lists.</p>

                        <h4>Searching Spotify for song data</h4>
                        <p>After obtaining the playlist URIs of the playlists chosen for scraping, we loop through each playlist to get the song URIs of every song.</p>
                        <p>Similar to user_playlist, we discovered that the spotipy function user_playlist_tracks only retrieves data from the first 100 songs in a playlist. Therefore, the function <i>get_playlist_tracks</i> was made to index through every song using a while loop. </p>
                        <p>To loop through every song of every playlist we use two for statements, one of them nested in the other.</p>
                        <p>For every song, the song URI and the year on chart are appended to separate lists.</p>

                        <h4>Retrieving song data and audio features (outputs)</h4>
                        <p>Now that we have the URIs of every song, we use the URI to search for the audio features and append them to a CSV file. </p>
                        <p>Again we use a for loop nested in a for loop to traverse through every song URI. The spotipy <i>track</i> function and <i>audio_features</i> function is used to retrieve data about an inputted song URI.  The former is used to retrieve the song name, and artist names, while the latter is used for audio features.</p>
<pre>songData = sp.track(songURI)
features = sp.audio_features(songURI)</pre>
                        <p>If songs have more than one artist, we traverse through the artist names and artist URIs, appending them to single strings.</p>
<pre>if len(songData['artists'])>1:

												<tr>
													<td>Acousticness</td>
													<td>A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</td>

												<tr>
													<td>Danceability</td>
													<td>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</td>
													<td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5YIF6HSOtHN9HdcE5IPzMe" width="80" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td>

												<tr>
													<td>Energy</td>
													<td>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</td>

												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Instrumentalness</td>
													<td>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.</td>
													<td>^</td>
                                                    <td>^</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Speechiness</td>
													<td>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. </td>

                                                    <td>A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</td>
                                                    <td>^</td>
