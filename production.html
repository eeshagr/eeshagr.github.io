                        <h4>Acousticness</h4>
                        
                            Looking at acousticness from 2007 onwards, overall there has been a clear increase, beginning at around 0.14 and ending at around 0.22 by 2019. This does not fit the overall trend for acousticness, which is a steady fall - an r-value of -0.7 confirms that overall there is quite a strong negative correlation, as looking at acousticness per decade, acousticness only began to rise in the 2000s. Acousticness fluctuates fairly regularly; there was a significant jump from 2018 to 2019, for example, yet overall it is difficult to pinpoint a believable trend which links less acoustic music over time to the introduction of streaming services.

                    <div class="box">
                        <h4>Danceability</h4>
                        Danceability
                        Between 1980 and 2019, intensity of danceability increased from 0.63 to 0.72. Meanwhile, the line of best fit went from 0.63 to 0.67. During this time period, the most significant decade of change was 1980-90, followed by 1970-80. The least significant change occurred in between 2000-10. It is important to comment on what could be an anomaly between 2005 and 2015, where danceability drops significantly below the long-term trend, fluctuates up and down and then rapidly spikes to its highest level in no more than a year. In similar research performed by The Echo Nest, no such anomaly is visible however the research also shows no long-term change in danceability over 60+ years <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/pop-music-louder-less-acoustic">(Dredge, 2013)</a>. A criticism of their data would be the use of the top 5,000 songs, compared to our Billboard top 100. An increasing sample size will reduce any trend as the pool of songs expands to include music of every variety. Thus, although other research does not show similar results, it cannot be concluded whether the change seen is an anomaly to the trend or our experimental error.

                    <div class="box">
                        <h4>Duration</h4>
                        The duration graph shows two trends. Between 1980 and 1990 it shows an increase from 4 to 4.7. Then, it decreases between 1990 to 2020, from 4.7 to 3.2. Interestingly, from around 2017 to 2020 a rapid decrease can be seen, from 3.7 to 3.2. This supports the theory that producers are incentivised to decrease the length of songs because they only need the first 30 seconds to be listened to for it to be counted as a stream. In our research we have also found that charts have become increasingly monopolised where the same artists are streamed over and over again. A possible explanation for the significant decrease in average duration since 2017 is that monopoly artists know that they will get streamed. This supports research by Kopf <a href="https://qz.com/1519823/is-spotify-making-songs-shorter/">(2019)</a> which shows how popular albums have a greater number of shorter songs, meaning more streams can be won from an album. This holds true for multiple genres, including country and rap. In order to maximise revenue from streaming, producers have continued to reduce track duration.

                        <h4>Energy</h4>
                        Between 1980 and 2019, intensity of energy increased from around 0.56 to 0.62. Meanwhile, the line of best fit went from 0.62 to 0.69. Interestingly, every decade other than the 2010 decade showed an increase, with the latter showing a decrease. Although this supports the hypothesis that adoption of streaming services impacted the energy of songs, the most significant change in energy occurred between 2010 and 2015, with 2015-2020 exhibiting a small decrease in energy. This does not directly support the hypothesis because the rate of adoption increased after 2013, with the number of streaming service users continuing to rise. Thus, according to our research framework, the rate of decrease of energy should have been higher in the 2015-2020 period rather than in the 2010-2015 period because the second half of the decade is when the most people were using Spotify.

                        <h4>Instrumentalness</h4>
                        Instrumentalness has been assumed to be a binary indicator, as it aims to predict whether a track contains vocals or not with any value above 0.5 intended to represent a track that is instrumental. Instrumentalness has fluctuated steadily from 1980 to present: whilst there is overall a downward trend, with an r-value of -0.49 indicating a negative correlation, the steady rise and fall from around 2000 onwards ending with a consistent period of zero intensity from 2015 to present suggests the overall trend is perhaps not indicative of the current level of instrumentalness. Songs on the Hot 100 from 2015 onwards are shown to never be instrumental tracks, which coincides with streaming services dominating music consumption.

                    <div class="box">
                        <h4>Speechiness</h4>
                       Speechiness overall is shown to have a clear increase from 1980 to present, starting at 0.042 and reaching 0.14 by 2019 - an r-value of 0.8 shows strong positive correlation. Around 2013, the increase in speechiness becomes far more rapid, with the most significant period of increase occurring around 2015. This is particularly notable due to the period of decrease in speechiness preceding after it peaked in 2003 at 0.144. Looking at intensity of speechiness per decade, the only time speechiness was not rising is from the 1970's to 1980's, showing that overall, music has been moving towards more speech present in tracks. Furthermore, it seems that around the introduction of streaming the rate of increase in speechiness in fact slowed down. Yet overall, the significance of these patterns is perhaps limited as these values indicate that on average most tracks are non-speech-like, as a value below 0.33 does not indicate that there is a significant amount of speech in tracks.

                    <div class="box">
                        <h4>Valence</h4>
                        Between 1980 and 2019, intensity of valence is shown to have a strong decrease from 0.65 to around 0.48. Meanwhile, the line of best fit decreased from 0.65 to 0.49. During this time period, the most significant decade of change was 2010-20, followed by 1990-00. The least significant change occurred in between 1970-80. The fact that the largest change occurred during the decade where streaming services gained prevalence supports the hypothesis that widespread adoption of streaming services in the 2010s influenced the production of music. However, valence shows a trend of decreasing since the 80s, with an R-value of -0.83, and the 1990s-00 decrease is nearly as steep as the changes in the 2010s. The most likely conclusion from the data is that a long-term trend of decreasing valence was accelerated by the adoption of streaming services.
